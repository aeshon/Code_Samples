A few code samples from my projects and classes


The LiveAnalyzer project is from my recent Synopsys Science Fair submission. It is used to detect the presence of invasive species of a bird in a natural environment. It uses a motion detection algorithm to take a picture. It then uses a convolution neural network to detemine if it is a bird and if so, it then uses another CNN to accurately identify a specific species of a bird. 

The FinalCNN is a project I worked on last year that takes in audio samples of road noise and converts them into spectrograms and then uses  a machine learning algorith to accurately identify a road surface (wet, gravel, highway) based on the spectrogram. This program was then downloaded onto a raspberry pi and I had it mounted to a remote control car tht I had jerry rigged so that the pi can change the speed of the motor based on the road noise. This project won a 3rd place prize at the Synopsys Science Fair and an award from the International System Safety Association.
FractCalc is a Java project that I did for my AP Computer Science class last semester. It took in a mixed fractions and an operator as input and had to accurately calculate the resulting output. The teacher had around 84 test cases and my program worked correctly for 83 of them.
